## Overview
An interface box just for a sustain pedal and expression pedal. Just connect the board to a USB-MIDI host and you're ready to go.

The sustain pedal has a polarity, but this program automatically recognizes it at startup, so you can use either one.

In my test, I used Seeed studio's XIAO, but I think it can be used with other SAMD21 boards and USB host boards.

For the enclosure, I've also uploaded an STL model I designed. Please use it by incorporating it inside.

I still have some ideas. I will update it when that time comes.

## Hardware

I tested with Seeed XIAO(SAMD21) board.

##### Parts
+ Seeed XIAO (or other boards)
+ **Two** 6.35mm Phone jacks with momentary switch
+ Enclosure
+ USB-C cable

### Enclosure
I made simple box by 3D printer. My case use Markforged Onyx.
The STL file is on this repository.

### Wiring

Connecting XIAO and jacks simply and gonna work.

## Software
This program requires a [MIDIUSB library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MIDIUSB).
Upload the sketch using the Arduino IDE.
